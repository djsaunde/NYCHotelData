# NYC Hotel Data Project

This repository contains code which pairs hotels with NYC taxicab trips based on
pick-up and drop-off locations. The main goal of this code (thus far) is to experiment
with geolocation and nearby taxicab trips while getting a feel for  time and 
memory constraints. These goals will evolve as the project moves forward.
