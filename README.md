# NYC Hotel Data Project

This repository contains code for projects associated with hotel data from New York City over the
course of the past several years, in the form of (latitude, longitude) coordinates of pickups and dropoffs
of taxicab rides and auxiliary taxicab ride data. The various notebooks and scripts in this repository
are designed to explore these datasets and there relation to hotels and tourist or business attractions
in the city. One major goal of this project is to make advertisement recommendations to hotels based on the
distribution of destinations of taxicab rides which originate near a given hotel. We are interested in
the global (24/7) distribution of such rides, and finer-grained distributions at the level of per-day and
per-hour / time period.
