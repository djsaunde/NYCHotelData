Unmasking Hotel Identities - Approach

- We need to load up the distances and hotel IDs spreadsheet, as well as the
hotel names, addresses, and distances spreadsheet.

- The end goal will be to create a new spreadsheet will columns for hotel name,
hotel address, and corresponding hotel ID.

- For each row of the (ID, distances) spreadsheet, we will look for the row in
the (name, address, distances) spreadsheet which minimizes the absolute value
difference in distances.

- In the new (name, address, ID) spreadsheet, we will create an entry including
the name and address of the matching row, and the ID of the row which we are
trying to match.
